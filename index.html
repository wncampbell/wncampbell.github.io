<p>Not to fret as we have launched a brazen rescue mission with our backup engineers and we are confident they at least moderately intelligent and of average bravery! But maybe we shouldn't have sent them all in the same ship again.. oh. Anyway we will put them all back to work on this site just as soon as they return to Earth!</p>
